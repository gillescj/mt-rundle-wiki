                            Mount Rundle is one of the most recognised Canadian mountains and has probably been on more
                            calendars than any other. Located in Banff National
                            Park overlooking the towns of Banff and Canmore, Alberta.<br><br>
                            The Cree name was Waskahigan Watchi or house mountain. In 1858 John Palliser
                            renamed the mountain after Reverend Robert Rundle, a Methodist invited by the Hudson's
                            Bay Company to do missionary work in western Canada in the 1840s

                            Mt. Rundle could actually be considered a small mountain range as the mountain extends
                            for
                            over 12 kilometres (7.5 mi), on the south side of the Trans-Canada Highway eastward from
                            Banff to Canmore with seven distinct peaks along the way. The third peak southeast of
                            Banff is the highest at 9,675 feet (2,949 m). West of the Spray Lakes road is the East
                            End of Rundle— locally known as EEOR (pronounced Eeyore)—which rises above Whiteman's
                            Gap
                            just south of
                            Canmore. The Rundle Peaks are part of the South Banff Ranges, along with its
                            siblings—the
                            Sundance Range, Sulphur Mountain and the Goat Range.

                            At the EEOR near Canmore there is a well-known scramble, the Goat Creek hiking trail, with
                            its starting point at parking trailhead, which starts at the Smith-Dorrien/Spray Trail just
                            south of the Canmore Reservoir above Grassi Lakes. This is also the beginning of the Mount
                            Rundle Traverse, a demanding trek to mount all of Rundle's peaks from Goat Creek parking lot
                            to the Banff Springs Hotel. Mount Rundle is one of the most popular scrambles in the area,
                            and is relatively straightforward for experienced hikers.
